> That man, I think, has had a liberal education who has been so trained in youth that his body is the ready servant of his will, and does with ease and pleasure all the work that, as a mechanism, it is capable of; whose intellect is a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its parts of equal strength, and in smooth working order. - Thomas Henry Huxley

> 我认为，一个接受过通识教育的人应该是这样的：他年轻时受到的训练可以使其身体服从自己的意愿，就像一台机器一样轻松而愉悦地从事一切工作；他的心智好比一台敏锐、冷静而有逻辑性的引擎，每个部分能力适当，并且有条不紊地运行着。
